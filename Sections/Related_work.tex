\section{Conclusion}
Data analysis has become more and more important and ubiquitous nowadays, which usually involves processing large collections of data. How to save computation time is a big concern for stakeholders. In the article, some papers on adapting the ideas of incremental view maintenance and view reuse from traditional database domains for emerging data analysis tasks are summarized and compared, which are dedicated to more efficient computation in data analysis tasks. Some future research opportunities are also discussed.
