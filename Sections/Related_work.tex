\section{Conclusion}
Machine learning algorithms have become more and more important and ubiquitous nowadays in many data analytics applications, which usually involves processing large collections of data. How to improve time performance is a big concern for stakeholders. In the article, some recent efforts on adapting the ideas of incremental view maintenance and query rewriting using views from traditional database domains for emerging data analysis tasks are summarized and compared, which are dedicated to more efficient computations in data analytics applications. 

As discussed earlier, those solutions were only suitable for some assumptions, which leaves future research opportunities on how to push the boundary further by weakening those assumptions. A typical example would be enabling the removal of data points for updating general machine learning models other than linear regression and naive bayes.

Plus, to our knowledge, in terms of the reuse of pre-computed results, only the research problem on reusing pre-computed model parameters is explored by some recent works. It would be an interesting direction to investigate whether it is likely to apply the similar ideas to reuse other pre-computed results discussed before, i.e. the prediction results and the result of general linear algebra programs.
